## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing with Postman/cURL

#### Register User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePass123!",
    "targetExam": "JEE",
    "preferredLanguage": "English",
    "preparationLevel": "Intermediate"
  }'
```

#### Login User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePass123!"
  }'
```

#### Create Course (with JWT token)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/courses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Advanced Mathematics",
    "description": "Comprehensive math course for competitive exams",
    "educatorId": 1,
    "targetExam": "JEE",
    "duration": "40 hours",
    "validityPeriod": "1 year",
    "price": 4999,
    "discount": 15,
    "courseType": "Video"
  }'
```

## üîí Security Features

- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with 12 rounds
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation
- **CORS**: Configured for cross-origin requests
- **Helmet**: Security headers middleware
- **Error Handling**: Sanitized error responses

## üìä Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with the following main tables:
- `Users` - User accounts and profiles
- `Courses` - Course information
- `Educators` - Educator profiles
- `Lessons` - Individual lessons
- `Tests` - Assessments and quizzes
- `Progress` - Student progress tracking
- `Subscriptions` - User enrollments

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

## üìà Performance & Scalability

- Connection pooling for database
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Efficient query patterns
- Proper error handling
- Graceful shutdown handling

## üêõ Common Issues

### Password Not Hashing
**Fixed**: Ensured bcrypt.hash() is properly called before storing passwords.

### JWT Secret Missing
**Fixed**: Added environment variable validation on startup.

### CORS Issues
**Fixed**: Properly configured CORS for development and production.

### Import/Export Inconsistency
**Fixed**: Standardized on CommonJS throughout the project.
